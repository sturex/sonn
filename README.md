# Self-organizing AI (RL)
_Here will be wider abstract soon, hold tight_

# ✨ Priceless thousand Source Lines of code ✨

While the core logic certainly will have few SLOC the abilities are expected to be very wide and powerful.

### Tags (technologies) which the project is relevant to:

| Tag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Neural network | Here are Receptor, Effector and Neuron abstractions. |
| [Self-organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization) | [Local rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) only are applied while the network grows. |
| [Reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) | No supervisor at all. True [Black Box abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box). |
| Structural adaptation | The network adjusts its structure adapting to the input signals. |
| Mathless approach | There is no math at all used in algorithms on network grow. |

## Current state

Rewriting the original Self-organized Neural Network pet project from the scratch. Fine-tuning core logic now.

Proof-of-concept, Single-threaded and Non-optimized.

It has visualization now!
